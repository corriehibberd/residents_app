           	 <h3>Scam postcards delivered to residents</h3>
           <p>	The personally addressed postcards say: “The office is attempting to reach you.  To claim this parcel and accept this offer, you must telephone the number below immediately and arrange for a delivery.  The item is prepaid, but a processing and delivery free of £10 must be remitted.  This fee can be paid only by telephone and only with a credit card (VISA or MasterCard).  This is your only notification”</p>
<p>If you call the 020 number you are asked to pay £10 by credit card.  Victims who have reported this to Action Fraud have said that the automated service told them the package would be delivered the same day, but did not receive anything. </p>
<p>Action Fraud has received several reports of this recently occurring fraud and this information has been assessed by National Fraud Intelligence Bureau (NFIB) resulting in disruption of the fraudster’s phone number.  Also be on the lookout for slight variations of this scam - which use different phone numbers and delivery items.  </p>
<p>If you receive one these postcards:Do not call the number provided. 
Do not give your card details.</p>
<p>If you receive a delivery card through your letterbox which you do not believe is genuine and which asks you to dial a premium rate number, you can contact PhonepayPlus on 0800 500 212 (Mon-Fri, 8am-6pm) for further guidance.
If you receive one of these delivery cards, do not pay any money and report it to Action Fraud by calling 0300 123 2040 or by using the online reporting tool.</p>
