      <h3><a class="anchor" id="top" name="purley"></a>Skyscraper proposed for Purley</h3>
      <p>Purley Baptist Church have produced a detailed proposal for construction on the Purley Cross site. See <%= link_to "http://purleycentre.commonplace.is", "http://purleycentre.commonplace.is/" %>.</p>
      <p>Croydon’s Labour Council is seeking to force the construction of a 16 floor skyscraper in the centre of Purley, on the site with the grey hoardings on Purley Cross.</p>
      <p>Parliamentary Candidate for Croydon South, Chris Philp, GLA Member Steve O'Connell and other local campaigners including ward councillors strongly believe that a 16 floor skyscraper is totally out of keeping with a peaceful town like Purley, and there is a danger that other developers will later try to use it as a precedent to build other skyscrapers in Purley. <%= link_to "Read more...", "http://www.croydonconservatives.com/news_search_results_detail.asp?StoryNo=1502" %></p>

     
      
      <!--<h3><a name="grave"></a>Medieval Gravestone discovered at All Saints</h3>
        <p>Builders working in All Saints churchyard have uncovered a medieval gravestone decorated with a celtic cross symbol.</p>
        <p>All Saints is currently undergoing building work to create level access into the church. Over the centuries the height of the ground outside the church has been raised, and there are now two deep steps down to get into the church.</p>
        <p>With disabled access in mind, the church council has recruited an architect to design a way of allowing level access for wheelchairs and those with walking difficulty to get into the church.<p>
        <p>The resulting design required a lowering of the path outside the church, and it was while builders were digging down that the gravestone was uncovered.</p>
        <p>The diocesan archaeologist was on hand to record the discovery and is very excited by the find. She said "I have never seen such a fine example of celtic art in this part of the country before!"</p>-->
