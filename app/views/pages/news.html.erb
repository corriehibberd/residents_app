    <h3><a name="chairman"></a>Chairman's Report Spring 2015</h3>
<p>The threat of the closure of the Purley Swimming Pool was the opening topic of my report for the Sanderstead News. I had drafted a letter to be sent to the Croydon Advertiser on behalf of seven South Croydon Resident Associations’ arguing the case for the Pool’s retention. I am delighted that the letter was not required because the Council reversed its decision to close the Pool prior to the Council meeting to confirm its closure. <%= link_to "...Read more", chairman_path %></p>

    <h3><a name="scam"></a>Scam postcards delivered to residents</h3>
  <p><%= truncate("The personally addressed postcards say: “The office is attempting to reach you.  To claim this parcel and accept this offer, you must telephone the number below immediately and arrange for a delivery.  The item is prepaid, but a processing and delivery free of £10 must be remitted.  This fee can be paid only by telephone and only with a credit card (VISA or MasterCard).  This is your only notification”</p>
<p>If you call the 020 number you are asked to pay £10 by credit card.  Victims who have reported this to Action Fraud have said that the automated service told them the package would be delivered the same day, but did not receive anything. </p>
<p>Action Fraud has received several reports of this recently occurring fraud and this information has been assessed by National Fraud Intelligence Bureau (NFIB) resulting in disruption of the fraudster’s phone number.  Also be on the lookout for slight variations of this scam - which use different phone numbers and delivery items.  </p>
<p>If you receive one these postcards:Do not call the number provided. 
Do not give your card details.</p>
<p>If you receive a delivery card through your letterbox which you do not believe is genuine and which asks you to dial a premium rate number, you can contact PhonepayPlus on 0800 500 212 (Mon-Fri, 8am-6pm) for further guidance.
If you receive one of these delivery cards, do not pay any money and report it to Action Fraud by calling 0300 123 2040 or by using the online reporting tool.",

  <h3><a name="pensions"></a>Pension Scams are on the increase in the UK</h3>
  <p>Pension scams can take many forms.  Many offer ‘One-off pension investments’, ‘pension loans’ or upfront cash to entice savers to transfer their pension funds.
Recently there has been a rise in the number of people falling victim to pension scams.  Many individuals are offered the opportunity to gain access to their pension early or obtain benefits, which just aren’t available or, in some cases real.  Fraudsters often approach their victims through cold calls, trying to gain attention by offering a free pension review.  Many of the people that offer these sometimes claim to be ringing as part of a Government initiative.  This can make what is an illegal activity; appear legitimate and very appealing for the victim.
If you’re approached in this way, you may be encouraged to transfer your pension quickly, and they may even send documents to you by courier in an attempt to pressurize you to sign.  <%= link_to "...Read more", news2_path %></p>
  <!--<h3><a name="grave"></a>Medieval Gravestone discovered at All Saints</h3>
<p>Builders working in All Saints churchyard have uncovered a medieval gravestone decorated with a celtic cross symbol.</p>
<p>All Saints is currently undergoing building work to create level access into the church. Over the centuries the height of the ground outside the church has been raised, and there are now two deep steps down to get into the church.</p>
<p>With disabled access in mind, the church council has recruited an architect to design a way of allowing level access for wheelchairs and those with walking difficulty to get into the church.<p>
  <p>The resulting design required a lowering of the path outside the church, and it was while builders were digging down that the gravestone was uncovered.</p>
  <p>The diocesan archaeologist was on hand to record the discovery and is very excited by the find. She said "I have never seen such a fine example of celtic art in this part of the country before!"</p>-->
