      <h3><a class="anchor" id="top" name="skyscraper"></a>Chris Philp MP urges us to sign a petition and object to plans to build a 17 storey skyscraper in Purley</h3>
      <p>Dear All, Last month, a planning application was submitted to build a 17 floor skyscraper in the centre of Purley on the site with the grey hoardings on Purley Cross.</p>
 
      <p>The owner of the site had wanted to build a much smaller building which included community facilities. However, Croydon Council has made various demands (including a £2m cash payment to the council and a significant social housing component which requires a subsidy) meaning that the only way the scheme is financially viable is to build 17 floors. The council has indicated in Pre-Application hearings that it is minded to approve the planning application for the 17 floor Skyscraper.</p>
 
      <p>I and many other local campaigners (including 7 local residents' associations) believe that a 17 floor skyscraper is totally out of keeping with a peaceful town like Purley, where the next tallest building is only 5 floors. There is a danger that other developers will in the future try to use this as a precedent to build more skyscrapers in Purley. Finally, there are only 37 parking spaces for 220 flats, which will add to the existing parking problems in Purley.</p>
 
      <p>The site does need redeveloping but a much smaller scheme would be more suitable. Full details of the planning application are on the council website under planning reference 16/02994/P.</p>
 
      <p>Please join me in opposing the skyscraper by doing the following:
      <ol>
        <li>Sign my online petition at: <%= link_to "www.surveymonkey.com/r/StopPurleySkyscraper", "https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/StopPurleySkyscraper" %>. Please also forward this link to as many friends and neighbours as you can.</li>
 
        <li>Submit your own objection directly to the council by this Monday (11th July)
Email them at <%= mail_to "development.management@croydon.gov.uk" %> quoting reference 16/02994/P explaining your views on the proposed scheme.</li>
 
       <li>Attend a demonstration on the steps of the Town Hall on Katharine Street in Croydon Town Centre at 6pm on Monday 18th July. This coincides with the start of the next full Council Meeting at which Councillors will be considering the Local Plan, which includes provision for a skyscraper in Purley.</li>
     </ol></p>
 
      <p>Please join me in trying to prevent this totally inappropriate skyscraper.</p>
 
      <p>Kind regards, Chris Philp MP, Member of Parliament for Croydon South</p>

      <p><%= image_tag "Purley_cubs.jpg", alt: "Purley Cubs" %></p>
      <p>On Saturday 28 February, 22 cubs and leaders from the 1st Purley Cub Scouts carried out a litter pick covering pockets of private land and footways between Purley Park Road, Brancaster Lane, Lower Barn Road, Mitchley Avenue, Buttermere Gardens, Ingleboro Drive and Honister Heights. They collected 38 bags of litter. The Cubs will now take part in a reflection session at cubs to look at how they felt when they saw the litter and how they felt after the litter was cleared. They will then look at how this will make them act in the future regarding litter. The cubs are working on their "Our World" badge, which asks them to identify an issue in the community and how the pack can help with it.</p>

      <p>Tracy Bellamy, Croydon Council Clean and Green Champion co-ordinator, thanks the 1st Purley Cubs who were polite, well behaved and a credit their pack.</p>

      <!--<h3><a name="grave"></a>Medieval Gravestone discovered at All Saints</h3>
        <p>Builders working in All Saints churchyard have uncovered a medieval gravestone decorated with a celtic cross symbol.</p>
        <p>All Saints is currently undergoing building work to create level access into the church. Over the centuries the height of the ground outside the church has been raised, and there are now two deep steps down to get into the church.</p>
        <p>With disabled access in mind, the church council has recruited an architect to design a way of allowing level access for wheelchairs and those with walking difficulty to get into the church.<p>
        <p>The resulting design required a lowering of the path outside the church, and it was while builders were digging down that the gravestone was uncovered.</p>
        <p>The diocesan archaeologist was on hand to record the discovery and is very excited by the find. She said "I have never seen such a fine example of celtic art in this part of the country before!"</p>-->
