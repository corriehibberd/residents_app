      <h3><a class="anchor" id="top" name="purley"></a>Skyscraper proposed for Purley</h3>
      <p>Purley Baptist Church have produced a detailed proposal for construction on the Purley Cross site. See <%= link_to "http://purleycentre.commonplace.is", "http://purleycentre.commonplace.is/" %>.</p>
      <p>Croydonâ€™s Labour Council is seeking to force the construction of a 16 floor skyscraper in the centre of Purley, on the site with the grey hoardings on Purley Cross.</p>
      <p>Parliamentary Candidate for Croydon South, Chris Philp, GLA Member Steve O'Connell and other local campaigners including ward councillors strongly believe that a 16 floor skyscraper is totally out of keeping with a peaceful town like Purley, and there is a danger that other developers will later try to use it as a precedent to build other skyscrapers in Purley. <%= link_to "Read more...", "http://www.croydonconservatives.com/news_search_results_detail.asp?StoryNo=1502" %></p>

      <h3><a class="anchor" id="top" name="trains"></a>Railway works, Christmas 2015</h3>
      <p>News from the East Surrey Transport Committee</p>
      <p>Christmas 2015</p>
      <p>The Southern main line is to be closed between South Croydon and Redhill from 22.30 24th December 2015 to 04.00 4th January 2016. This is to allow the replacement of the points and crossings at the north end of Purley Station.</p>
      <p>There will be extra trains to East Grinstead with coaches from there to Gatwick Airport.There will also be through trains from Victoria to Gatwick Airport via Horsham. Replacement buses will run between East Croydon and Redhill. There will be a shuttle train service between Coulsdon Town and Tattenham Corner. It is also hoped to run a shuttle service between Coulsdon South and Redhill.</p>
      <p>The committee was concerned that there was to be major disruption on the main line, again, over Christmas and there was a long discussion about why it had to be done in one go. We asked why the work could not be carried out on the fast and slow lines at different times so that the trains could be kept running. We were told that the scale of the work was similar to the replacement of Stoats Nest Junction at Christmas 2013 and this was the best way to carry it out. The replacement of the junction is to be a like for like replacement so that there will be no changes to the signalling. However the spacing between the crossovers is to be increased to simplify maintenance. If the points on the fast and slow lines were replaced at different times there would be problems because it would not be possible for trains to switch between the fast and slow lines and there would be much more overall disruption.</p>
      <p>It is intended to replace the railway bridge at Old Lodge Lane at the same time.</p>

     
      
      <!--<h3><a name="grave"></a>Medieval Gravestone discovered at All Saints</h3>
        <p>Builders working in All Saints churchyard have uncovered a medieval gravestone decorated with a celtic cross symbol.</p>
        <p>All Saints is currently undergoing building work to create level access into the church. Over the centuries the height of the ground outside the church has been raised, and there are now two deep steps down to get into the church.</p>
        <p>With disabled access in mind, the church council has recruited an architect to design a way of allowing level access for wheelchairs and those with walking difficulty to get into the church.<p>
        <p>The resulting design required a lowering of the path outside the church, and it was while builders were digging down that the gravestone was uncovered.</p>
        <p>The diocesan archaeologist was on hand to record the discovery and is very excited by the find. She said "I have never seen such a fine example of celtic art in this part of the country before!"</p>-->
