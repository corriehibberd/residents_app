                <h3><a class="anchor" id="top" name="beeches_sept"></a>Purley Beeches working party. Sat September 15th 10 - 1 </h3>
                <p>What a summer! Hopefully all of our members have enjoyed the abundant sunshine and are well rested, fortunately the rain did return in time to save our newly planted trees, however the most recently planted oaks do look to be the worse for wear, but I am sure they will recover.</p>
                <p>Spring bulb planting will be the major thrust of this month’s work party, last year we found that the most efficient way to plant the hundreds of bulbs was to cut an angled slit with a spade, lever up the earth, slip 3 or 4 bulbs into the void and then press the soil back into place. If we have the same quantity of bulbs as last year the job will probably spill over into October, but it is quite likely that this time we might have help from our local Beavers/Cub groups, one of the leaders has contacted us and asked if they can help, we shall have to be very mindful of safety, but they could save us oldies from so much bending down as they place the bulbs into the soil.</p>
                <p>SPADES, would seem to be the most useful hand tool for this occasion, so if you have one in your shed, please be sure to bring it with you. We will meet at this year’s base camp, approx. start time 10am, the usual finger signs will be posted to this site, to lead in new volunteers and from there we will spread out to the various planting sites.</p>
                <p>It is good that the Beeches are increasingly being used, other than just by dog walkers. A Forest School is soon to start bringing toddlers into the woods, this has been agreed to by FOPB and the Council, so don’t be surprised. The silent Cinema is also returning on the 14th for a showing of Pretty Woman. FOPB were pleased to note that the green area was left in perfect condition after the last showing, which was great success. It is planned to do some recruiting for FOPB at this next one.</p>
                <p>Please do come to this work party, the more the merrier, looking forward to meeting up with the usual gang and hopefully some new faces.</p>

                <p>Family Fun is a monthly activity based service  for all children up to the age of 12 years, and their parents​, grandparents​ and carers.

We end our time together​ with a tasty snack and refreshments for all. Children take home everything they have made.</p>
