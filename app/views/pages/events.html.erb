                <h3><a class="anchor" id="top" name="beechesnov"></a>Friends of Purley Beeches Bonfire Party. Saturday 13 November</h3>
                <p>Friends of Purley Beeches bonfire party. Sat 13 November, 8am to 3pm.</p>
                <p>Wow! Are we going to have a bonfire this time? There is so much stacked and well dried timber ready to burn that it is planned to light up at 8am and continue until mid-afternoon. Naturally it isn’t expected that everyone is there the whole time, so as usual, drop by when and for as long as you like.</p>
                <p>The fire will need to be carefully managed and a perimeter rope will be in place to stop anybody getting too close. Any timber not burnt at the end of the day will be left for our March 2022 bonfire and the fire will be left in a safe and secure manner and monitored over the following 24 hours.</p>
                <p>Most of the timber will require cutting to bonfire size so please bring loppers and bow saws if you have them, although we do have a stock in our Green Room. There is plenty of wood still to be collected from around the Beeches, so lots of helpers of all ages are required. If you get bored with the bonfire, our Friends of Wettern Tree Gardens could do with some help in continuing to pull ivy out of their hedges, but gloves are essential for this job as ivy sap is an irritant.</p>
                <p>There are always hot embers floating down so it is important that everybody wears clothing that doesn’t matter if an ember lands on them and also a hat of some description should be worn for the same reason.</p>
                <p>Sharp eyes might have noticed that the 13th November is a week earlier than originally planned for our bonfire, please make sure you come on the right day. Advanced notice that the date of the AGM has also changed and will now be held on Wednesday 8th December, it will be a proper face to face AGM, in St Mary’s Church, unless covid rules change in the meantime, more details and agenda will follow in due course.</p>
