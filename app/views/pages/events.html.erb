              <p>(GR 323 605) In areas where sheep and cattle have been grazing the number of flower species has multiplied. Enjoy the colours and the insects they attract. This two hour walk leaves from Riddlesdown Common car park at the top end of Riddlesdown Road. Volunteer Marion's walks explore local countryside, wildlife and history. Boots are advised as paths may be muddy, and waterproofs in case of rain. Dogs allowed if on leads. Finish at the start point. Walks are free.</p>

                <h3><a class="anchor" id="top" name="beeches"></a>Purley Beeches work party Saturday, 23rd July</h3>
               
                <p>Now it’s back to the regular stuff. It’s time to start clearing the spring growth around our newly planted saplings and to help with this the FOPB has bought a couple of sickles, but only to be used by experienced persons. More path widening and of course, continuing to press on into our new site, which looks bigger each time I visit. Removing dead wood and the thick undergrowth is the order of the day. Fortunately the ground has hardened which will make access to and from the site easier. I think most people now know where the site is, so it would make sense for the early birds to go directly there rather than waiting at the gate.</p>

                <p>The usual request for hand tools and appropriate gloves, shoes and clothing apply. We will keep to the revised time of 10am to 1pm and the next work party date, July 23rd</p>
                <p>For further information please email or call Stanley Lowy: 020 8657 3684 or <%= mail_to "stanlowy@outlook.com" %>, Elizabeth Bennett: <%= mail_to "bennett_e@sky.com" %>, Mac Court   <%= mail_to "mac@skyy.me.uk" %></p>
