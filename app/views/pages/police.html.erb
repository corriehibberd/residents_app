            <h3><a name="leaflets"></a>Suspicious leaflets in doors</h3>
            <p>Police and Trading Standards are warning residents in Croydon to look out for flyers being jammed into door frames or windows and to remove them immediately. Whilst there is no suggestion that the company named on the flyer is connected with this in any way, the placing of the flyer could be used as an indicator to note if a resident has returned home or not – and if the property is unoccupied. Residents are advised to remove the flyers immediately and to look out for flyers on neighbours premises, and to remove those too, especially during the summer holiday period. Report any suspicious leaflets to Trading Standards on 03454 04 05 06</p>

            <h3><a name="driveway"></a>Scammers offering to clean your driveway</h3>
              <p>The police ask us to report any suspicious activity and car registration numbers from people knocking at doors offering to clean driveways or do building work. </p>
              <p>"Just to advise that there are two men going house to house trying to get any building work or drive cleaning. We are used to that but this one today said to my wife, who answered the door, something like "we'll have to turn off the stop tap while we do the work ..." Sounds like the scam where an unsuspecting pensioner might be left holding the tap while they help themselves to valuables"</p>

             <h3><a name="garages"></a>Advice about keeping your garages and sheds secure</h3>

            <h3>Advice about Motorcycle crime</h3>

            <h3>Burglary Advice - Keeping your Jewellery safe</h3>

            <p>Review your home security. Always check your doors and windows are secure. Consider where your home is vulnerable by thinking how you would break-in if locked out? - Fit an intruder alarm, CCTV and security lighting.</p>

            <p>If you must keep it at home. Use an insurance approved safe which must be securely fixed. Remember, if you can lift it in, thieves can lift it out.</p>

            <p>Remember what is attractive to you, is also attractive to thieves - Keep safe, keep it out of sight.</p>

            <p>Photograph and keep a detailed inventory of each item of Jewellery and keep it in a separate place.</p>

            <p>Include the value, date acquired, receipts, valuation certificate and any indentifying marks. If it is stolen, this gives us the best opportunity to recover your precious items and convict the thief.</p>

            <h3>Distraction Burglary</h3>

            <p>Don't allow unexpected callers in to your home unless they have a prior appointment.</p>

            <p>Think before you open the door - use your door chain and spy hole or look out of the window to see if you recognise the person at the door.</p>

            <p>Always ask for identification and check it before letting somebody in to your home. Use the phone number in the phone book, for the company that they claim to be from, not the one shown on their identity card. Remember, a genuine caller will happily wait outside while you check on them by calling their organisation and/or while you call a family member or neighbour to help.</p>

            <p>If you are not convinced of the identity of the caller, don't let them in. Ask the caller to come back later and arrange for a friend, relative or neighbour to be present on their return or ask the caller to contact this person to make arrangements on your behalf.</p>

            <p>Beware of callers who attempt to distract you by claiming that they have seen something untoward in your rear garden or somewhere which may encourage you to leave your house - or the room that you are in - they may have an accomplice awaiting this distraction.</p>

            <p>Utility providers now offer a password identification system. Any caller from one of these companies should be able to give you a pre-arranged password as additional proof of their identity.</p>

            <p>If you feel threatened or in danger by the presence of a caller ring the police on 999.</p>

            <h3>Motor Vehicle Crime Advice</h3>

            <p>Take all valuables including sunglasses with you if you can. If you are unable to take them from the vehicle lock them in the boot or place them out of view. Remove parking permits, radio face plates and portable satellite navigation systems including their cradle ensuring to wipe the window where the satellite navigation holder may have left a visible mark.</p>

            <p>Fit a locking petrol cap if your vehicle doesn’t already have one. Fit anti tamper screws on your number plates and locking wheel nuts if not standard to your vehicle. If you require any please let us know.</p>

            <p>Consider getting a steering lock or gearstick lock and pedal box to improve security of your unattended vehicle. Park with care, particularly at night or if you are leaving the vehicle for some time. If possible always park in a busy, well lit area. Managed car park facilities may be a better choice a list of police approved safer car parks can be found at the British Parking Association website. Try to avoid leaving car keys close to your front door or in a visible location. A thief can reach in using a hand or device and steal the keys to your vehicle. Fitting a plate to the rear of the letterbox opening can prevent this.</p>

            <p>If you don’t have one fitted as standard consider getting an immobiliser or an alarm professionally installed. Steering locks and pedal boxes are also a visible deterrent. A tracking device fitted to your vehicle will assist with locating it should your vehicle be stolen.</p>
