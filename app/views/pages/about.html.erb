	<h1>About the Sanderstead Residents' Association</h1>
	<p>In 1926 The Sanderstead Ratepayers' Association was formed, later to be known as The Sanderstead Residents' Association (SRA). The SRA is entirely non-political and non-sectarian. It is primarily concerned with promoting and stimulating interest in local government so as to safeguard the interests of residents and to assist members in Sanderstead, Hamsey Green and adjoining areas in local matters.</p>
